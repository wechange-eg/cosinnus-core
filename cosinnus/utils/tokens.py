    """
    Strategy object used to generate and check tokens for the list-unsubscribe email blacklist mechanism.
    
    Taken and modified from `django.contrib.auth.tokens.PasswordResetTokenGenerator`. 
    Note: This does not actually use any information that isn't accessible to the user 
    (only the timestamp and email are used for token generation), so this is *not* a secure token!
    
    However since we use it only as a permission to blacklist an email, *and* it needs to be available
    for non-registered users, and we do not want to persist tokens for this in the DB,
    we think it is an acceptable compromise as an alternative to having a "naked" unsubscribe URL,
    where anyone could unsubscribe an email at their leisure.
